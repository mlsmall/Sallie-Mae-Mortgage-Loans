# Sallie-Mae-Mortgage-Loans

For this project, we will be working with Sallie Mae's mortgage loan data. The goal is to predict whether a mortgage loan will be forclosed in the future.  

The data can be [downloaded here] (http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/data/loan-performance-data.html). The files used were from 2015 Q1 performance and acquisition tables.

The data was prepared using postgreSQL before it was imported into python. The code used is called "SQL query", and you can find it in this folder.

The prepared data is in the folder called "prepared data" and the file you can run in python is called "Sallie Mae.py".
